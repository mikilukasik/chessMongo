<tr>
<td align="justify" style="padding-top:15px;"> I was generally interested in all technology since I was a small child, I always wanted to know why things do what they do. I started writing small computer programs as a hobby since I was 6. Later I was fixing computers as my day to day job in Hungary.  When I moved to London I started to work in hospitality, in which field I spent almost 10 years and worked my way up to the senior management level. During this time I made countless excel sheets for various purposes, this included writing a good amount of VBA code. <br><br>
In the spring of 2015 I decided to learn to be a Web Developer. Since then I learned the basics of javaScript, and as a practice I am creating a chess portal. I feel that I am ready to take on a role as a Junior Web Developer and leave my carrier in the hospitality industry behind. </td>

<td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2">The project is to build a portal where people can play chess against each other or against the computer.<br>

The computer's moves are calculated using the processing power of all connecteded clients simultaneously, while trying to keep low server usage.
<br><br>
The project uses:
<ul>
<li>	node.js </li>
<li>	express</li>
<li>	mongoDB</li>
<li>	jQuery</li>
<li>	angular.js</li>
<br>	
<li>	HTML5</li>
<li>	web sockets</li>
<li>	web workers</li>
</ul>
<br>
	
Typed arrays and some bitwise operators are used to improve speed.
	
The project is far from being done, it mainly serves as a training excercise.</td>
