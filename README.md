This is my first JS project.

It aims to be a portal where people can play chess against each other or against the computer.

The computer's moves are calculated using the processing power of all connecteded clients simultaneously,
while trying to keep low server usage.

The project uses:

	node.js
	express
	mongoDB
	jQuery
	angular.js
	
	HTML5
	web sockets
	web workers
	
Typed arrays and some bitwise operators are used to improve speed. 
	
The project is far from being done, it serves as a training excercise.
